# Pharma Management System — Module 1: Authentication

Production-grade authentication for the Pharmacy Management System.

**User**: Register (email verification sent) → Login → Dashboard → Logout
**Admin**: Admin Login → Admin Dashboard → Logout
**Recovery**: Forgot password → Email link → Reset password

## Security features implemented

- **httpOnly cookies** for JWTs — tokens are inaccessible to JS, immune to
  token-stealing via XSS
- **Access + refresh token rotation** — short-lived (15 min) access token,
  long-lived (30 day) refresh token; the client silently refreshes on
  expiry (see `client/src/api/axios.js` interceptor)
- **Server-side session revocation** — refresh tokens are hashed and stored
  on the user document, so logout invalidates them immediately
- **express-validator** on every auth input (email format, password
  strength, phone format)
- **Rate limiting** — tighter limits on login/admin-login to slow
  brute-force attempts, generous limits elsewhere
- **Centralized error handling** — `AppError` + `catchAsync` + a single
  global error handler that translates Mongo/JWT errors into clean messages
  and hides internals in production
- **Email verification** — verification link sent on registration
  (`REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION=true` in `.env` to enforce it before login)
- **Password reset** — time-limited, single-use, hashed reset tokens
- **Request logging** via morgan
- **Configurable CORS** for one or more client origins

## Medicine data (guest browsing)

The home page lets guests browse medicines without logging in. It's seeded
from the **[Indian Medicine Dataset](https://github.com/junioralive/Indian-Medicine-Dataset)**
(253,973 real medicines — name, price, manufacturer, composition, pack
size), which is community-maintained and free to use. Check that repo for
attribution/licensing details if you plan to deploy this commercially.

The CSV is already included at `server/data/indian_medicine_data.csv`.
**Use this script** to load the curated, common-medicine subset (~1,150
medicines with demo stock/category/featured/discount data — this is the one
the storefront is actually built around):

```bash
cd server
node scripts/importCommonMedicines.js
```

⚠️ There's also a `scripts/importMedicines.js` left over from an earlier
version of this project, which imports the *entire* 253k-row dataset with
none of the demo stock/category/offer data populated (medicines will show
as permanently out of stock, and the Offers/Popular rows will be empty).
**Don't use it** — it's kept only for reference and prints a warning if run.

This streams the CSV (so it doesn't load 31MB into memory at once), inserts
in batches, skips malformed rows, and builds the text search index used by
the browse/search bar. Re-running it clears and re-imports the collection.

### Other data source options (for later modules)

- **[openFDA](https://open.fda.gov/apis/drug/)** — free, no key required for
  moderate use, updated daily. Good for supplementary drug label info
  (warnings, dosage, interactions) fetched live via the Django
  `python-service`, rather than bulk-imported.
- **[RxNorm (NLM)](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/)** — free
  API for normalized drug names/ingredients, useful for matching brand
  names to generic equivalents.

### New public API endpoints

| Method | Endpoint              | Access | Description                                  |
|--------|------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------|
| GET    | /api/medicines          | Public | List/search medicines — `?search=&sort=&page=&limit=` |
| GET    | /api/medicines/:id      | Public | Get a single medicine's details               |

`sort` accepts `name`, `price-asc`, `price-desc` (defaults to relevance when
searching, name otherwise).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- MongoDB running locally (or an Atlas connection string)

## 1. Backend Setup (server/)

```bash
cd server
cp .env.example .env      # edit MONGO_URI, JWT_SECRET, REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET
npm install
npm run dev                # starts on http://localhost:5000
```

Use two different long random strings for `JWT_SECRET` and
`REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET` — never reuse one for both.

If `SMTP_HOST/USER/PASS` are left blank, verification/reset emails are
printed to the server console instead of actually sent — useful for local
testing without a real mail provider.

### Create the first Admin account

Public registration always creates a `user` role account. To create an admin:

```bash
cd server
node seed/createAdmin.js "Admin Name" admin@pharma.com "StrongPass123"
```

### API Endpoints (Module 1)

| Method | Endpoint                       | Access         | Description                          |
|--------|----------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| POST   | /api/auth/register               | Public         | Register + send verification email    |
| POST   | /api/auth/login                  | Public         | Login as user or admin                |
| POST   | /api/auth/admin/login            | Public         | Login restricted to admins            |
| POST   | /api/auth/refresh                | Public*        | Exchange refresh cookie for new access token |
| GET    | /api/auth/verify-email/:token    | Public         | Verify email from emailed link        |
| POST   | /api/auth/forgot-password        | Public         | Request password reset email          |
| POST   | /api/auth/reset-password/:token  | Public         | Set a new password                    |
| GET    | /api/auth/me                     | Private        | Get current logged-in profile         |
| POST   | /api/auth/logout                 | Private        | Logout, revoke refresh token          |
| GET    | /api/user/dashboard              | Private (user) | User dashboard placeholder            |
| GET    | /api/admin/dashboard             | Private (admin)| Admin dashboard placeholder           |

\* requires a valid `refreshToken` cookie

Auth uses httpOnly cookies (`accessToken`, `refreshToken`) — the browser
sends them automatically; nothing to manage manually on the client.

## 2. Frontend Setup (client/)

```bash
cd client
cp .env.example .env       # points to the backend API
npm install
npm run dev                 # starts on http://localhost:5173
```

### Pages

- `/` — public home page (opens by default), with a top navbar (Home, Login,
  Register, Admin — swaps to Dashboard/Logout once signed in)
- `/login`, `/register`, `/admin/login`
- `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password/:token`
- `/verify-email/:token`
- `/dashboard` (user, protected), `/admin/dashboard` (admin, protected)

### UI

Redesigned around a "prescription pad" visual system — dashed perforated
card edges, mono-styled field labels, `lucide-react` icons on every input
(mail, user, phone, lock, show/hide password), toast notifications, and a
soft email-verification nudge banner. Admin screens use a distinct warm
accent so the two roles are visually unmistakable.

### Getting real password-reset emails working

`forgot-password` always works, but where the email actually goes depends
on your `.env`:

- **Nothing configured** → sent to a free Ethereal test inbox; the server
  console prints a clickable preview link so you can see the email content,
  but it never reaches a real address.
- **Gmail (easiest for real delivery)** → set `SMTP_SERVICE=gmail`,
  `SMTP_USER=you@gmail.com`, `SMTP_PASS=<App Password>` (create one at
  https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords — requires 2FA on the account).
  Restart the server after editing `.env`.
- **Any other provider** → set `SMTP_HOST`/`SMTP_PORT` instead of
  `SMTP_SERVICE`.

Email sending never crashes the request — if SMTP fails, the error is
logged to the server console and the API still responds normally.

## Module 2 — Shopping, Orders & Admin (complete)

**Catalog:** ~1,150 curated common medicines (see "Medicine data" above),
categories, brand/price/prescription/stock filters, Offers/Popular/Recently
Added rows, medicine detail page with a live openFDA lookup.

**Cart & Checkout:** server-persisted cart (login required), quantity
controls, address form with browser-geolocation + free OpenStreetMap
preview (swap in real Google Maps later once you have an API key — the
integration point is `client/src/pages/Checkout.jsx`'s `mapSrc`), COD / UPI
(Demo) payment, atomic stock decrement with rollback if stock runs out
mid-checkout.

**Order tracking:** Pending → Confirmed → Packed → Out for Delivery →
Delivered. Auto-progresses on a demo timer (~45s/stage) until an admin
manually sets a status — at that point `demoMode` flips off and the real
status is trusted everywhere (`GET/PATCH /api/admin/orders`).

**User self-service:** cancel an order while it's still Pending/Confirmed
(`PATCH /api/orders/:id/cancel`, auto-restocks); download a GST-style PDF
invoice at any time (`GET /api/orders/:id/invoice`) — the GST breakup is a
simplified flat-12%-back-calculated-from-MRP demo, clearly labelled as such
on the invoice itself, since the dataset has no real per-medicine HSN/GST
slab data.

**Admin:** `/admin/orders` — view every order, filter by status, change
status (or cancel or download an invoice) for any order.

**Profile:** edit name/phone/address, view order history link.

## What's Next (Module 3+)

- Medicine CRUD & stock/expiry management from the admin panel (currently
  stock only changes via checkout/cancellation, not direct admin editing)
- Offline POS billing
- Sales/inventory/expiry analytics (Django + Pandas), CSV reports
- AI chatbot & prescription-based medicine alerts
- Real Google Maps integration once an API key is available
